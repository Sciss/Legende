# Phase

the phase has the effect that the first oscillation would shift to the next frequency after `1.0 - (phase % 1.0)` 
cycles. Thus we need an argument to `calcRMS` with relative cycle length (e.g. 0.75 for first, then 1.0).
In the synthesis we should extend the period vector to ensure we cover the original num-frames, and truncate / `take`.
So over iterations, length remains constant.

Then, the run at `start == 0` implies that we clip `minPeriod` to stuff divisible by four.
