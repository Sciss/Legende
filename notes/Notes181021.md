# Resample routes

- given num-in, num-out, min-factor
- produce a resampled array of size num-out from an input array of size num-in,
  where the step factor begins at 1.0
- so we need to integrate something, i.e. `ds/dt = 1 for t = 0` and `integral(ds) = min-factor`

like `i = 0 until out-size, x.pow(i), x = min-factor.pow(1.0 / out-size)` ?
