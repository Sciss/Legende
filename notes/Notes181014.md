- decompose signal using seg-mod
- e.g. use frequencies sr/n, n = 2 ... 1500
- use low amplitude (e.g. 1/m, m = 100 to 1000) and layer
- find best paths, e.g. with Viterbi?
- problem is Viterbi input sequences do not have the same lengths?

- use Dijkstra
- need to limit graph size (nodes and edges)
- if we use the frequency division, we could say node = point in time,
  and the total number of nodes would be around 6 * sr per second, which is fine.
  (_no, wrong_, it will be `numFrames / 2`)
  ; number of edges will be `numFrames * numFrequencies.log2`

Seems doable with respect to the graph size.

--------

Perhaps limit frequency drift to shrink number of edges. E.g. neighbouring
periods for edge search must have `absDif(_, _) <= x` with `x = 1` for example.

Examples:

- `numFrames = 6971; numFreq = 99` -- num edges is 678111, i.e. around num-frames times num-freq
- `numFrames = 6971; numFreq = 199` -- num edges is 1360161, dito
