- decompose signal using seg-mod
- e.g. use frequencies sr/n, n = 2 ... 1500
- use low amplitude (e.g. 1/m, m = 100 to 1000) and layer
- find best paths, e.g. with Viterbi?
- problem is Viterbi input sequences do not have the same lengths?

- use Dijstra
- need to limit graph size (nodes and edges)
- if we use the frequency division, we could say node = point in time,
  and the total number of nodes would be around 6 * sr per second, which is fine.
  (_no, wrong_, it will be `numFrames / 2`)
  ; number of edges will be `numFrames * numFrequencies.log2`

Seems doable with respect to the graph size.
